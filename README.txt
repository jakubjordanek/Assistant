These repository contains simple virtual assistant files. It includes:
- Registration of a new account and the ability to log in to it,
- Each account gets its own cloud where it can upload photos and .txt files,
- I made the website around Euro 2020, so for fun I added the "Euro 2020" tab, where the tournament results were updated on a regular basis,
- The website also contained a calendar, unfortunately it has not been finished,
- The entire website is also adapted to mobile devices.
